# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticketclass, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

# TASK 4
# SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Here's a full summary of the code and steps for sales prediction using Python, including data cleaning, EDA, model training, and inference:

**Step 1: Import Libraries**

In this step, we import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

**Step 2: Load the Data**

We load the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

**Step 3: Data Cleaning**

We check for missing values in the dataset and handle them if necessary. In this dataset, there might not be any missing values.

**Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

We perform EDA to understand the data's distribution, relationships, and statistics. This includes calculating summary statistics, creating pairplots to visualize relationships between variables, and generating a correlation heatmap to examine correlations between variables.

**Step 5: Feature Selection**

Based on the insights gained from EDA, we select the relevant features (independent variables) for the prediction. In this case, the selected features are TV advertising expenditure, Radio advertising expenditure, and Newspaper advertising expenditure.

**Step 6: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**

We split the data into training and testing sets to train the machine learning model and evaluate its performance. The data is divided into training and testing sets using a 80-20 split ratio.

**Step 7: Model Training**

A Linear Regression model is trained using the training data. Linear regression is chosen as the modeling technique for predicting sales.

**Step 8: Model Evaluation**

We evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. These metrics help assess how well the model fits the data and makes predictions.

**Step 9: Make Predictions**

We demonstrate how to make predictions using the trained model. New data points, representing advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper, are used to predict sales.

**Step 10: Inference**

Based on the output and visualizations, we can draw the following inferences:

- TV advertising expenditure has a strong positive correlation with sales.
- Radio advertising expenditure also has a positive correlation with sales, albeit weaker than TV.
- Newspaper advertising expenditure has a relatively weak positive correlation with sales.

This model can be used to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs, optimize advertising strategies, and predict future sales based on advertising expenditures.

The code and analysis provided here serve as the foundation for a comprehensive sales prediction report, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions and maximize their sales potential.

# TASK 5

# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

The "CreditGuard" project is a machine learning-based credit card fraud detection system designed to protect credit cardholders and financial institutions from fraudulent transactions. It employs data preprocessing, machine learning models, and class imbalance handling techniques to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions. Key features include real-time prediction, user-friendly interfaces, and rigorous model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project aims to mitigate financial losses and enhance security in the world of credit card transactions. Future enhancements may include advanced machine learning techniques and continuous model retraining to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
